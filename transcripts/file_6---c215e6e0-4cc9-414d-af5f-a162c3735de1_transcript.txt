 Let's put a pause in the discord investment stuff. For now it's just too much admin to join you in as a bot, but I may go to a copy paste model at some point. But for now I'll just put a pause in it. If you could have a look for Chris Camillo, his book, it's a little bit on the old side now, about his investment strategy. If you have a look at that and tell me what you think about it, that's kind of the idea that I'm hoping to look forward as far as investment needs stuff goes.
