 This approach is not about the property leads. It's purely about for stock market stuff. That's one half of what I'm looking at at the moment. Yeah, you could deep dive the book if you liked. And I think it's not just keywords of like investment relevant trends. It's trends of anything. Somebody saying, hey, this is the hottest new toy or yeah. And then figuring out what company makes the toy or something and looking at it there. Not necessarily like people talking about investment stuff on social media.
