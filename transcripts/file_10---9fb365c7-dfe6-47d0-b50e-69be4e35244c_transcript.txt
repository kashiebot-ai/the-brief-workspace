 Anywhere in Hawks Bay is fine, Hastings, Napier have lot more Teradale, Clive, literally it was on some Hawks Bay Napier Hastings areas generally. No, any type of property is probably fine. I don't know if we necessarily need it to say explicitly do up or anything like that, but I'm trying to find a gap where it's valuation is high and they're potentially happy to sell it for lower because of its condition. I can bring it up to speed and improve it a bit. I think I like the dashboard integration on the mission control. And yeah, just go for it, do it as much as we can. Happy to use real estate in Z as well. Yeah, any other websites you think would be useful. And any other areas or angles that you think are missing for it would be great as well.
