## 🚨 HIGH-CONVICTION SIGNALS (Act within 24-48h)

**Signal #1:** [Event Name]
- **What happened:** [Brief description of news event]
- **Company/Sector exposed:** [Who benefits or is hurt]
- **Market awareness:** [How much has the crowd priced it in? Market awake/asleep?]
- **Edge thesis:** [Why the stock/sector likely hasn't moved enough yet]
- **Time window:** [How long before the info spreads broadly]
- **Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low — based on clarity + data quality]

Example:
```
Signal: US-Iran Strait of Hormuz Shipping Risk
What: US Navy issued new guidance for vessel transits through Strait of Hormuz (2% of global oil)
Exposed: Energy stocks + Oil (any company with oil/gas supply chain exposure to Iran/Middle East)
Market awareness: Oil ticked up 0.5-1% but no major energy stock repricing yet
Edge thesis: Supply risk priced in oil futures, but not in equities (lag). Companies like GDRZF (resources) 
             historically benefit when shipping costs spike or geopolitical risk rises.
Time window: 2-3 days before equity analysts connect the dots and trigger repricing
Confidence: High (clear signal, historical precedent)
```
