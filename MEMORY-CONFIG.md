# Memory Enhancement Config

## Memory Flush & Session Search

Implement two features to enhance memory retention:

### 1. Memory Flush
Before compaction, save the most important parts of our conversation so context isn't lost after memory cleanup.

### 2. Session Memory Search
When I mention something that seems forgotten, automatically search through our entire conversation history to retrieve it.

---

These two features combined make memory ~1000x better, preventing context loss mid-conversation.

Apply this every session.
