# 2026-02-17 - Daily Memory

## Previous Day's Key Edges (Carryover to Tuesday)
- **Venezuela sanctions easing (Friday‑Monday):** US issued general licenses allowing BP (BP), Chevron (CVX), Shell (SHEL), Eni (ENI), Repsol (REP), ConocoPhillips (COP), Reliance to resume Venezuelan oil operations.
- **Iran nuclear talks (Tuesday):** Iran signals flexibility ahead of Geneva talks; US dispatches second aircraft carrier, preparing for sustained military campaign if talks fail. Potential sanctions easing for energy, mining, aircraft sectors.
- **Combined geopolitical edge:** Dual sanctions‑easing story hitting while US markets closed (President's Day). Tuesday open could see concentrated buying in oil & gas (CVX, COP, XOM), mining (GDRZF sympathy), aerospace (BA, EADSY).
- **Oracle (ORCL) lawsuit:** Securities fraud class action lawsuit filed Monday (Feb 16) while markets closed; potential downward pressure Tuesday.

## Evening Development (21:00-21:36) - Mission Control Gateway Integration
- **OpenClaw Gateway proxy API implemented:**
  - Created `/app/api/openclaw/route.ts` that forwards tool calls to Gateway at `localhost:18789`
  - Uses bearer token authentication (`2afb0bb...`)
  - Respects Gateway tool policies (deny list blocks sensitive tools)
- **NextAuth authentication added:**
  - Full dashboard protection via middleware
  - Credential login with default `admin`/`password`
  - Session management with JWT
  - Sign‑in page at `/auth/signin`
- **Real‑time gateway status widget:**
  - Dynamic connection checking every 30s
  - Shows "Connected"/"Disconnected" status
  - "Open Gateway UI" button added to dashboard
- **Updated environment configuration:**
  - `.env.local` with Gateway URL, token, and NextAuth secrets
  - Default credentials for development
- **Dashboard enhancements:**
  - System Status widget now shows live OpenClaw status
  - All routes protected; unauthenticated access redirects to sign‑in
  - Mission Control dashboard fully operational at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Integration status:** Gateway API successfully connected and authenticated. Dashboard can now invoke OpenClaw tools via secure proxy.

## Credential Update (21:45-21:50)
- **Request:** Update dashboard authentication credentials for password manager storage
- **New username:** `kashie` (login credential)
- **New password:** Secure 25-character password generated (saved to user's password manager)
- **Display name:** `Kashie Admin` (shown in dashboard header)
- **Changes made:**
  - Updated `.env.local` `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD`
  - Modified NextAuth user object to return name: "Kashie Admin"
  - Updated sign‑in page hint text (removed default credentials)
  - Restarted Next.js dev server
  - Noted change in MEMORY.md
- **Security:** Password includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters (`@`, `!`, `-`)
- **Status:** New credentials active, old `admin`/`password` no longer valid

## OpenClaw Config Update (22:05-22:10)
- **Request:** Use Haiku for heartbeat checks to reduce costs (~$0.01/day)
- **Changes made:**
  - Added Anthropic provider configuration to `models.providers` with base URL `https://api.anthropic.com`, API `anthropic-messages`, and models `claude-haiku-4-5` and `claude-sonnet-4-5`
  - Set `agents.defaults.heartbeat.model` to `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`
  - Applied config patches via Gateway; restarted successfully
- **Impact:** Heartbeat checks will now use cheaper Claude Haiku model, saving ~$54/month vs using Opus (as per cost optimization strategy). Next heartbeat will run on Haiku.
- **Status:** Configuration updated, gateway restarted, Haiku ready for use.

## Heartbeat Check (21:47)
- **Investment edge hunting:** No new developments in last hour. Iran talks continue (Bloomberg 2h ago, NPR 2h ago). Venezuela sanctions easing unchanged. No new FDA approvals.

- **Property lead scouting (Tuesday):** Not scheduled (Mon/Wed/Fri). No new leads.
- **Discord:** Not joined.
- **Weekly education:** Not today (Sunday task).
- **Assessment:** No new urgent edges beyond previously flagged edges (dual geopolitical sanctions‑easing story, FDA oral Wegovy approval, Oracle lawsuit). Markets closed; earnings releases pending.
- **Action:** HEARTBEAT_OK.

## Security Hardening Assessment (22:15-22:20)
- **Trigger:** User requested healthcheck skill for security audit.
- **Context:** macOS 26.3 (headless Mac mini), Application Firewall enabled, FileVault off, Time Machine configured but not running, automatic download updates enabled.
- **OpenClaw status:** Gateway bound to `127.0.0.1:18789` (loopback), Tailscale off, update available (2026.2.15).
- **Security audit:** 0 critical, 1 warn (`gateway.trusted_proxies_missing`), 1 info (elevated tools enabled, browser control enabled).
- **Risk profile selection pending:** User needs to choose between Home/Workstation Balanced, VPS Hardened, Developer Convenience, or Custom.
- **Identified gaps:** FileVault disabled, backup status unclear, automatic security‑update policy incomplete, OpenClaw update pending, no scheduled security audits.
- **Next step:** Await user decision on risk profile and execution option (guided, plan only, fix critical issues, export commands).

## Security Posture Decision (22:30-22:35)
- **FileVault:** Keep disabled to allow auto‑login after restart (required for remote access via Tailscale + screen sharing).
- **Backups:** Time Machine not needed currently (user decision).
- **Updates:** Manual updates preferred (user will apply when convenient).
- **Remote access:** Tailscale + macOS Screen Sharing used for remote management from another location.
- **Tailscale status:** Currently off but will be enabled for remote access.
- **OpenClaw update:** Ready to apply (2026.2.15 available).
- **Risk profile:** **Custom** – Balanced with convenience for remote headless operation.
- **Key constraints:** No FileVault, manual updates, Tailscale for remote access, gateway loopback‑only (safe).
- **Memory capture:** This security posture recorded to avoid re‑discussion.

## OpenClaw Video Insights (Alex Finn YouTube Transcript) (22:40-22:45)
- **Source:** Alex Finn "OpenClaw Complete Guide" YouTube video transcript (shared by user).
- **Key concepts extracted:**
  1. **Brain dump introduction:** Critical first step – tell OpenClaw everything about yourself, goals, preferences (already captured in `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md`).
  2. **Morning brief setup:** Custom daily report with: weather, top news in interests, tasks from to‑do list, "task you can complete for me today" (reverse prompting element).
  3. **Mission control:** Custom Next.js dashboard for building tools (already built and integrated).
  4. **Brains & muscles:** Use Opus/primary model as "brain" (orchestrator), specialized models as "muscles" (Codex for coding, XAI for social, Brave for web search). We've implemented similar: DeepSeek Reasoner as brain, Haiku for heartbeat, Brave for search.
  5. **Reverse prompting (most important):** Ask "what should we build?" instead of telling what to build. Let OpenClaw think for itself based on goals.
  6. **Self‑improvement mindset:** When it fails, ask it to build a skill to do better next time.
  7. **Discord advanced workflows:** Multiple channels for different stages (alerts → research → scripts).
  8. **Security mindset:** OpenClaw has admin access to everything on computer; don't expose to group chats or public to avoid prompt injection.
  9. **Local models endgame:** Future direction – run models locally on hardware (Mac Studio) for unlimited tokens and personalized intelligence.
  10. **Manager mindset:** Treat OpenClaw as super‑intelligent employee; give end‑state goals, not implementation steps.
- **Alignment with our setup:** We have implemented core concepts (mission control, cost optimization, brain/muscle pattern, security posture). Missing: formal morning brief cron job, Discord workflow (pending invite), deeper reverse prompting practice.
- **Memory capture:** These insights stored to avoid re‑watching video; can reference for future workflow improvements.

## Security Hardening Execution (22:45-22:55) - Steps 1,2,3 Completed
- **Step 1 – Update OpenClaw:** Successfully updated from 2026.2.14 to 2026.2.15. Gateway restarted, running latest version.
- **Step 2 – Apply safe defaults:** Ran `openclaw security audit --fix`. File permissions tightened (`~/.openclaw/agents/main`, `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions`). Warning about `gateway.trusted_proxies_missing` remains (low risk, gateway is loopback‑only).
- **Step 3 – Schedule periodic audits:** Created two cron jobs via `openclaw cron add`:
  1. **`healthcheck:security-audit`** (`496c287f-...`): Daily at 8:00 AM Pacific/Auckland. Runs `openclaw security audit` in isolated session, reports critical/warning issues.
  2. **`healthcheck:update-status`** (`67470b1c-...`): Weekly on Sundays at 9:00 AM. Runs `openclaw update status`, reports if update available.
- **Cron job details:** Both jobs target isolated sessions with announce delivery to last channel (Telegram). Will run automatically per schedule.
- **Tailscale:** User indicated Tailscale is okay but not needed immediately; remote access via Screen Sharing works.
- **Completion:** Security hardening completed per healthcheck skill requirements. System now has daily security audits and weekly update checks.

## Workflow Adjustments (22:55-23:05) - Per User Instructions
- **Property lead scouting paused:** User instructed to stop property leads immediately ("You don't have a proper way to source any"). Removed from HEARTBEAT.md, Morning Brief, and MEMORY.md project status set to PAUSED.
- **Morning Brief updated:** Removed property leads and system health checks. Health checks will run separately (daily security audit at 8:00 AM, weekly update check Sunday 9:00 AM) and only notify if attention needed.
- **System health check preference:** User prefers checks every few days, not daily in morning brief. Added to Preferences in MEMORY.md.
- **Cron jobs updated:** Morning Brief (6:30 AM) now focuses on weather, investment edges, upcoming reminders, and "task I can complete today" (reverse prompting).
- **Investment edge hunting continues daily** via Brave Search API (free tier).
