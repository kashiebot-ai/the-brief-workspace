# Daily Memory — Saturday, February 21, 2026

## Session Summary


## Work

- Received test cron job (ID: 613448f3-fce0-4912-a06d-860761e3fcd7) at midnight. Responded with summary.
- **Brave API rate limit correction:** User reminded that rate limit is 1 query/minute (not 1/second). Updated TOOLS.md with correct limit and 60+ second delay guidance after reviewing first-day setup memory (2026-02-09.md).
- **Cron test job error analysis & fix:** Investigated midnight cron test job delivery failures (Feb 20-21). Job was isolated agent with announce delivery; likely channel routing issue at midnight. Removed unnecessary test job (613448f3-fce0-4912-a06d-860761e3fcd7). All other cron jobs healthy.

## Findings

**Investment Edge Hunt (5:00 AM):** U.S.-Iran escalation (Feb 19-20) with fresh Trump warning re: Strait of Hormuz. Oil at 6-month highs (Brent $72.09, WTI $66.78). Thesis: Energy majors (XOM, CVX) likely to see tailwinds Tuesday open after President's Day. Signal is fresh but already pricing Friday close—edge is momentum continuation Tuesday.

**Property Scraper Status (7:33 AM):** Tested `property_scraper_robust.py` – works successfully (extracted 18 listings). Urllib3 warning about LibreSSL is just a warning, not an error. The scraper is healthy.

**System Health Check (7:40 AM):** OpenClaw update available (2026.2.19-2). Disk space OK (168Gi available). Gateway running. Added system health checks to HEARTBEAT.md (daily rotation).

**OpenClaw Update (7:45 AM):** Applied update via `openclaw update.run`. Version upgraded from 2026.2.15 to 2026.2.19-2. Gateway restarted successfully.

## Open Items

- Monitor XOM/CVX Tuesday market open for strength (energy play on Iran tensions)
- Daily security audit (8:00 AM): 0 critical, 1 warning (low risk), 1 info. No escalation needed.


## Afternoon Progress (13:00–18:00)

- **Address matching flaw discovered:** LINZ API key (4c5b18e5c1e04cb8b9819538260cdb18) works but current algorithm matches too loosely. Example: "65 Margaret Avenue" incorrectly matched to "5 MARGARET EGGERS DRIVE" due to substring matching.
- **Root cause:** Current `integrate_linz_with_listings.py` uses street‑name substring matching (ILIKE) and falls back to ignoring street number, causing false positives.
- **Fix planned:** Rewrite matching logic to require exact street‑number match and whole‑word street‑name matching, with better handling of abbreviations/directionals.
- **Heartbeat checks (13:25, 17:25):** No action needed (system healthy, investment edge hunting deferred to sleep hours, education Sunday).
- **User gave the day to work on fix;** aim to have high‑precision matching by evening.

## Evening (18:00–19:00)
- **Brave API rate limit committed to memory:** Updated MEMORY.md with explicit note: "Rate limit: 1 query per minute (free tier) — must space searches 60+ seconds apart". This ensures future searches respect the constraint.
- **LINZ API also has rate limits** (likely ~10–100 requests/minute) — will add exponential backoff to property‑tool queries.

## Overnight Build: Affiliate Marketing Automation System (19:00–06:00)
