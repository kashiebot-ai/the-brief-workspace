### Blockers
- Domain negotiation in progress (not blocking development)

## 🔄 Active Codex Projects

<!-- Felix pattern: Track long-running Codex jobs here for heartbeat monitoring -->

- No active Codex sessions

## Findings

### Key Decisions
- Logo design approach: Switched from OpenAI image generation (API key expired) to hand-coded SVG designs — more control, better scalability, instant results

### New Information
- *(To be updated as session progresses)*

### Preferences Observed
- *(To be updated as session progresses)*

## Open Items

- [ ] Weekly review: The Brief progress and direction (Sunday routine)

## Memory Consolidation (02:00 AM)

**Sessions reviewed:** 2026-02-28 daily note + session history  
**Method:** Automated script attempt + manual consolidation  
**Timestamp:** Sunday, March 1, 2026 02:00 AM NZST

### Summary
- Previous daily note (Feb 28): Showed zero session activity (template-only note)
- Consolidation log from Feb 28: Comprehensive extraction completed
- Key project: The Brief (civic news platform) — Active since Feb 27
- Status: Build phase initiated; awaiting domain finalization

### Key Information Extracted

#### Active Project Status
**The Brief (NZ Political Transparency Platform)**
- **Launched:** Feb 27, 2026 (pivot from affiliate marketing)
- **Election date:** Nov 7, 2026 (252 days from Mar 1)
- **Tech stack:** Next.js + Sanity CMS (custom, not WordPress)
- **MVP scope:** Policy explainers + VoteFinder quiz + newsletter
- **Hosting:** Vercel (free tier, temp URL)
- **Domain:** Negotiation in progress (won't block build)

#### Workflow & Directives
1. **Two-chat structure (established Feb 27-28)**
   - Planning HQ: Strategy, decisions, all Brief work
   - This chat (DM): System settings, non-Brief projects
   - File-based collaboration: All drafts in `projects/the-briefing/`

2. **Content pipeline established**
   - Save location: `projects/the-briefing/content/`
   - Filename format: `explainer-[topic-slug].md`
   - Always update: `CONTENT_PIPELINE.md` with status
   - Include: Status, Last Updated, Review Notes in each file

3. **Build-first mentality**
   - Iterative development preferred
   - Start simple, expand from there
   - Temp domain acceptable; migrate later

#### Lessons from Recent Context
- Vianni noticed context pollution in shared MEMORY.md across chats (Feb 28)
- Solution implemented: Two-chat workflow with separate file storage
- Pattern observed: Vianni responds to blockers by isolating chats/files
- Implication: Future projects → assume separate chats to prevent context bleed

#### Vianni's Operational Pattern Confirmations
1. **Time awareness critical** — I made timestamp errors on Feb 28; user corrected immediately
2. **Recent context not "ancient"** — Feb 27 discussions still active, not archived
3. **Action-ready:** Once analysis provided, acts same day (affiliate example: research → signup in hours)
4. **Systematic preference:** Prioritized lists with direct links and clear status

### Knowledge Files Updated

**Files current as of Feb 28, 02:00 AM:**
- `memory/life/tacit/vianni.md` — Full operational profile + Feb 28 time-correction lesson
- `memory/life/tacit/security.md` — No updates needed (Telegram as auth channel confirmed)
- `memory/life/knowledge/projects/the-brief.md` — Complete project profile
- `memory/life/knowledge/projects/affiliate-marketing.md` — Archived (superseded)

### Consolidation Actions Completed
- [x] Reviewed previous day's daily note
- [x] Validated project knowledge files
- [x] Verified active directives and chat structure
- [x] Checked tacit knowledge for completeness
- [x] Identified any new blockers or patterns (none new; all documented)
- [x] Created today's daily note with consolidation log

### Status Check
**Nothing requires immediate proactive action.**
- The Brief development on track; domain doesn't block build
- No urgent blockers identified
- No API issues outstanding (Moonshot provider was logged Feb 28)
- Vianni on weekend schedule; typical availability/responsiveness

### Proactive Opportunities (For Heartbeat/Initiative)
1. **The Brief site scaffold** — Could spin up Next.js template if domain confirmed
2. **Content research** — Could begin researching first 5 explainer topics (government announcements)
3. **Quiz design** — Could draft VoteFinder quiz questions framework
4. **Newsletter setup** — Could research Buttondown/ConvertKit free tier options
5. **Weekly review prep** — Prepare Sunday update on Brief progress for Vianni

*Consolidation complete. System ready. No critical alerts. All files current.*

### 03:13 - Logo Design for The Brief

**Task:** Design logo options for The Brief political news platform

**Challenge:** OpenAI API key invalid (can't use openai-image-gen skill for AI generation)

**Solution:** Created hand-coded SVG logos instead with 3 concepts:

1. **Silver Fern + Document** - NZ heritage (fern) meets political documentation
2. **Parliament Beehive** - Direct reference to iconic NZ Parliament building  
3. **Voting Tick + Speech Bubble** - Democracy/civic engagement theme

**Deliverables:**
- 3 full logo SVG files with typography
- 3 favicon-optimized SVG variants
- `preview.html` - Interactive viewer with dark/light mode toggle
- `logo-concepts.md` - Detailed descriptions of all 5 ideas (including 2 not implemented)
- `README.md` - Technical docs + next steps

**Technical features:**
- CSS `@media (prefers-color-scheme)` for automatic dark/light adaptation
- Tested at favicon sizes (16px, 32px, 64px)
- Monochrome palette (extensible to NZ colors)
- Zero dependencies

**Location:** `the-brief/public/logo/`
**Commit:** 774f358

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Vianni review
**Next:** Select preferred concept → Refine → Export PNG/ICO → Integrate to Next.js

**Learning:** When external API unavailable, hand-code SVG. Often faster + more control than AI image gen for logos anyway.
