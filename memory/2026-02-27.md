**Primary reference:** 2026-02-24 (last substantial session)  
**Method:** Manual review + daily note extraction

### Summary

- Project updates: 3 (Taskade link acquired, affiliate DB expanded, new programs researched)
- Preferences observed: 2 (research-heavy before action, speed matters post-analysis)
- Blockers flagged: 1 (OpenClaw provider config for Moonshot/Kimi K2.5)

### Key Information Extracted

#### Decisions Made
1. **Affiliate Program Strategy Finalized (Feb 24)**
   - Prioritize programs WITHOUT audience requirements
   - Focus: AI Studios, ClickUp, Anyword, Monday.com (in order)
   - Secondary tier: Taskade (50% lifetime, link acquired), BasedLabs AI, Mixo
   - Closed/unavailable: Notion, Copy.ai
   - Result: 24-program database built, 5 programs ready for signup

#### Project Updates (Affiliate Marketing)
1. **Taskade Integration Complete** — Affiliate link acquired: https://www.taskade.com/?via=k1b
2. **Affiliate Programs Database** — Expanded from 19 → 24 programs (17 NZ-friendly)
3. **High-Commission Research** — Identified 5 aggressive programs paying 40-50%: Taskade, AI Studios, BasedLabs AI, Mixo

#### Preferences Observed
1. **Research before action** — User wants comprehensive analysis (vetting, audience requirements, priority ranking) before committing
2. **Speed after clarity** — Once analysis provided, user executes same day (Taskade example shows sub-24h signup)
3. **Systematic approach** — Prefers prioritized lists with direct links and clear status indicators

#### Action Items/Blockers
1. **BLOCKING: OpenClaw Provider Config** 
   - Issue: Provider "moonshot" not recognized by OpenClaw schema
   - Impact: Can't test Kimi K2.5 model integration (API key verified working)
   - Status: Needs investigation into provider configuration methods
   - Fallback: Environment variable approach or alternative integration method

2. **LIVE: Affiliate Program Signup** (Feb 25 status)
   - 4 priority programs ready for signup (AI Studios, ClickUp, Anyword, Monday.com)
   - User confirmed ready
   - Blocking full launch: Domain + hosting + WordPress setup
