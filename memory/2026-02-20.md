# Daily Memory — Friday, February 20, 2026

## Session Summary


## Work

- **Heartbeat frequency reduced:** Updated OpenClaw config to change heartbeat checks from hourly to every 4 hours (from 24 checks/day to ~6 checks/day) per user request
- **Brave Search API learning:** User noted rate limit pattern: search sequentially (1 query/second) to avoid hitting per-minute limits; save to memory for overnight proactive work
- **Property flipping project strategy:** Discussed and approved 4-step plan for Napier-focused property opportunity detection using price filter mapping to estimate prices for "negotiation" listings, then compare with LINZ CV data to find value gaps
- **Property Price Mapper framework built:** Created core system architecture (`property_price_mapper.py`) with:
  - `PropertyListing` class to store listing data with CV integration
  - `PriceBracketMapper` class to map listings across price brackets
  - Opportunity scoring based on CV gap + sale method urgency
  - CSV export with ranked opportunities
- **TradeMe API investigation:** Discovered TradeMe GraphQL API is accessible; identified need for proper query structure or browser automation for price filter iteration
- **Demonstration created:** Working demo that loads real realestate.co.nz listings, simulates price bracket mapping, and exports opportunity rankings

## Findings

- **TradeMe GraphQL API accessible** but requires proper query structure; price filter UI interaction likely needs browser automation
- **Address matching challenge**: LINZ data uses different address formats than listings; need fuzzy matching algorithm
- **Price bracket mapping feasible**: TradeMe has URL parameters for price filters (`price_min`, `price_max`), enabling systematic scanning
- **Framework validation**: Core algorithm works correctly; simulated data shows plausible CV gaps (16-18% discounts)

## Open Items

- **Phase 2 implementation**: TradeMe price filter scraper with browser automation
- **Address matching improvement**: Fuzzy matching for LINZ CV data integration  
- **Daily automation setup**: Cron job for morning property scan
- **Validation**: Test system with known sold properties to calibrate accuracy
