# 2026-02-10 - Property Lead Hunting + Setup

## Session Summary
Updated SOUL.md with memory flush + session search. Installed local Whisper. Configured Brave API. Starting core proactive work tonight.

## Key Setup Completed
1. **Local Whisper installed** — Voice note transcription (~/clawd/transcribe_audio.py)
   - Telegram voice messages auto-transcribe when sent to me
   - Transcripts saved to ~/clawd/transcripts/
   - Integration with cron jobs (7am + 10pm reflections) planned for tomorrow

2. **Brave API configured** — Live and tested
   - Key: BSA1RY3H6n3lRsz-9OTk5de_2dAL1fa
   - Free tier: 2000 queries/month
   - Ready for investment edge hunting

3. **Memory flush + session search enabled** — Updated SOUL.md
   - Before compactions: Save critical context to MEMORY.md
   - During conversations: Auto-search backward if I don't remember something
   - Goal: Maintain continuity across sessions + compactions

## Tonight's Work
**Property lead hunting (starting now):**
- Facebook Napier landlord/investor groups (frustrated owners)
- Reddit r/nzproperty (Napier-specific help requests)
- Google Maps (property managers with poor reviews)
- Airbnb/Bookabach owners in Napier (holiday rental investors)
- Council building consents (active renovators = investor signals)

**Building:**
- Lead tracker (JSON file): address, owner name, contact details, source, status, notes
- Investment edges log (daily hunting results)

**Deliverable by morning:**
- Lead tracker with 5-15 qualified prospects
- Contact details cross-referenced via NZ Company Registry/Google
- Brief on findings

## Tomorrow's Agenda
1. **Review leads together** — Quality assessment, contact info validation
2. **Build outreach templates** — Tone, messaging, follow-up sequence
3. **Set up self-reflection cron jobs** — 7am (overnight work review) + 10pm (daily reflection)
4. **Council records setup** — Map data sources for automated property acquisition monitoring
5. **Research:** Best money-making approaches using OpenClaw (weekly Sunday task)

## Decisions Made
- **Hybrid approach:** Hot leads (FB/Reddit) + warm (council records) + professional referrals (later phase)
- **Goal:** 1 client/week (quality/quantity balanced approach)
- **Data sources:** Public only for now (council records, company registry, title searches, social media)
- **Outreach:** You'll do initial contact; I'll assist with templates/follow-up sequences
- **Automation:** Start manual tonight, automate after patterns emerge

## Context for Vianni (Reminders)
- Timezone: NZ (Pacific/Auckland, UTC+13)
- Sleep: 10:30pm-6am (overnight = my hunting hours)
- Budget: Cost-conscious learner (Haiku appropriate)
- Primary goals: Investing edges + property leads + direct income
- Proactive style: Work overnight, surprise with results in morning
- Openness: Unusual/creative lead sourcing welcome
