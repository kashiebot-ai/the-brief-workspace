## Session Summary
Heartbeat: Investment edge hunting (Saturday). Flagged Indian IT AI fear, US government shutdown risk, Munich Security Conference.

## Heartbeat Check (02:04)
- **Indian IT stocks** – AI fears wipe out $50B in February (Infosys, TCS, Wipro at 10‑month lows). Reuters: "Indian IT shares logged their worst week in more than 10 months." Signal: Market may be overreacting to AI disruption threat; potential oversold bounce vs structural decline.
- **US government shutdown** – Partial DHS shutdown looms Saturday unless last‑minute deal. Could spook markets Monday.
- **Munich Security Conference** – continues with "wrecking‑ball politics" warning (defense/geopolitical stocks).

## Heartbeat Check (03:22)
- **Indian IT tariff relief** – Trump announces withdrawal of 25% tariff on Indian exports (imposed Aug 2025) in February 2026. Signal: Tariff relief could offset AI‑fear selloff, creating potential bounce opportunity (Infosys, TCS, Wipro).
- **Equinix (EQIX)** – shares rally after 2026 revenue guidance beat on accelerated AI demand (data‑center operator). Signal: AI infrastructure demand broadening beyond chips to data‑center REITs.
- **US Foods Holding (USFD)** – up 13.4% after Q4 earnings beat and optimistic 2026 guidance.
- **Unilever (ULVR)** – down on cautious 2026 guidance, Magnum ice‑cream weakness.
