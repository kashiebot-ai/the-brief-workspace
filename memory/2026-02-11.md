## Session Summary
- Vianni clarified education priorities: Daily = money hunting, Sundays = OpenClaw/AI concepts + how to use me better
- Built OPENCLAW_EDUCATION.md (surface-level overview covering memory, models, tools, architecture, task definition)
- First deep dive topic (Sunday): Memory & How to Use It

## Work
- Completed property lead sources mapping (Napier City Council, LINZ, Companies Registry, HBPIA)
- Researched AI agent income models (custom builds, lead gen, market research subscriptions, property lead monetization)
- Created education doc for Vianni

## Findings
- **Income paths identified:** Custom agent builds ($10k+/month), lead gen ($500-5k/month), market research subscription ($500-1k/month), property leads ($500-2k/month)
- **Best starting point:** Market research subscription (test 1-2 Discord groups) + property lead generation (5 leads/month to local agents)
- **Research gaps:** Need to identify 1-2 target Discord investing groups + 3-5 Napier property manager outreach targets
