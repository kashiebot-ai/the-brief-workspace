# February 12, 2026

## Session Summary
**Greenland deep dive complete. HAL (Halliburton) selected as primary trade.**

**Trade Setup:**
- Entry: HAL stock $32-35 (NOW)
- Thesis: Infrastructure play for Greenland mining development (overlooked by Street)
- Exit: Sell 50% at $48-52 when "Halliburton wins Greenland contract" (June 2026 expected)
- Upside: 50-60% gain in 4 months
- Timeline: March → June 2026

**Tracking Active:** 5 cron alerts set (March 15, April 15, May 15, June 1, June 15)

## Work
- [ACTIVE] HAL Greenland tracking (see hal-greenland-tracker.md)
  - Daily: HAL stock vs $32 baseline
  - Daily: CRML/Amaroq mining press releases
  - Weekly: Greenland political news
  - Monthly: Options pricing (IV expansion signal)
- [TODO overnight] Scan for HAL Arctic contract rumors
- [TODO] Monitor CRML/Amaroq investor pages for permit updates
- [TODO] Track Trump-Denmark deal status (March catalyst)

## Findings
- HAL has zero mentions paired with Greenland (massive analyst blind spot)
- Infrastructure is 50%+ of mining economics, but Street only tracks ore producers
- HAL already winning Arctic contracts (Brazil deepwater, NEP carbon capture)
- Remote operations expertise = perfect fit for isolated Greenland
- Contract awards expected June 2026 (realistic 4-month window)

## Open Items
- HAL current live price (as of Feb 13 morning)
- CRML/Amaroq permit application timeline confirmation
- Trump-Denmark deal status (formal agreement timing)
- Which specialty contractors bidding alongside HAL?
