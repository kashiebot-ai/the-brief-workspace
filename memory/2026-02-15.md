## Weekly Education Research (Sunday)
- **Topic:** What's working for others using OpenClaw for money
- **Sources reviewed:**
  1. **OpenClaw vs Polymarket: Automated Trading Strategies on Phemex (2026)** – Discusses using OpenClaw to arbitrage between Polymarket prediction markets and centralized exchanges (\"Oracle Gap\"). Claims of high ROI but warns of slippage/gas fees.
  2. **OpenClaw 2026.2.12 + Codex Spark** – Performance update; faster workflows, lower latency, security improvements. Enables more efficient automation loops.
  3. **OpenClaw Runbook 2026** – Comprehensive operational guide covering:
     - **Cost optimization:** Model routing, cheap models, hardware decisions, monthly cost breakdowns.
     - **Agent prompts & configuration:** 5 specialized agents (Monitor, Researcher, Communicator, Orchestrator, Coordinator).
     - **Memory configuration:** Cheap embeddings, context pruning, compaction.
     - **Heartbeat & task tracking:** Rotating heartbeat pattern batching checks on cheap model, Todoist integration.
     - **VPS deployment:** Hetzner + Tailscale, firewall hardening, backup scripts.
     - **Security hardening:** Prompt injection defense, tool policies, gateway lockdown.
     - **Skills & tools:** Building custom skills, quota monitoring.
     - **Config reference:** Annotated openclaw.json, production setup.

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Cost optimization is critical** – Most users burn money on default models; routing to cheap models (e.g., Haiku for heartbeat, Codex for coding) saves 80‑90%.
2. **Heartbeat batching** – Rotating checks on cheap model (e.g., hourly Haiku) instead of frequent Opus reduces cost from ~$54/month to ~$0.01/day.
3. **Automation opportunities** – OpenClaw can be used for:
   - **Prediction market arbitrage** (Poly market vs CEX latency)
   - **Property lead generation** (council records, company registry scraping)
   - **Investment edge hunting** (geopolitical/news scanning)
   - **Social arbitrage** (monitoring Discord/Twitter for sentiment gaps)
4. **Security hardening** – Essential for production use; gateway lockdown, sandbox mode, prompt injection defenses.
5. **Skills ecosystem** – Building custom skills for specific workflows (e.g., property lead tracker, edge scanner) is where most value is captured.

**Actionable Ideas for Us:**
1. **Implement cost optimization** – Review our model usage; switch heartbeat to Haiku, use Codex for coding tasks.
2. **Build property lead automation** – Use LINZ API + council records scraping (post‑weekend).
3. **Explore prediction market arbitrage** – Evaluate Polymarket vs Phemex latency opportunities (requires API integration).
4. **Enhance edge hunting** – Expand social arbitrage scanner (33 keywords) and run full scans overnight.
5. **Security audit** – Apply runbook's security hardening to our gateway (firewall, tool policies, sandbox).

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule deep dive on cost optimization (Monday)
- Complete LINZ API registration (Monday)
- Research Polymarket API feasibility
- Run social arbitrage scanner full scan tonight

## Weekly Education – Clarification & Corrected Session (22:43)
- **User clarification:** "Weekly education is meant to be about you and how you work. I want to understand more about AI so I can better utilize it. I'm a complete novice."
- **Correction made:**
  - Updated `HEARTBEAT.md`: Changed weekly education description from "research what's working for others using OpenClaw for money" to "help Vianni understand AI/assistants better to utilize me more effectively."
  - Updated `MEMORY.md`: Noted misunderstanding, kept previous research as reference.
- **Education delivery attempt 1 (22:43):** Failed – Telegram message too long (ID 716).
- **Education delivery successful (22:44):** Split into three parts (IDs 713, 714, 715) covering:
  1. What I am (AI assistant, not chatbot)
  2. How I work (context, tools, memory, reasoning)
  3. Key concepts (models, tokens, cost, heartbeat)
  4. How to think about AI (brain dump, reverse prompting, custom tooling)
  5. Practical tips
  6. Next week's deep dive: How memory works
- **Outcome:** User now has foundational understanding to better utilize AI assistant. Weekly education task now correctly aligned.

## Model Preference Clarification (22:51)
- **User question:** "Sweet - also you think we are still using haiku? Hasn't that changed?"
- **Current model check:** `session_status` shows `deepseek/deepseek-reasoner` (not Haiku).
- **Memory check:** `MEMORY.md` still lists "Model preference: Haiku (cost-conscious learner)" (outdated).
- **Evidence:** `memory/2026-02-13.md` shows "DeepSeek Reasoner primary" and "Model‑switching strategy pending".
- **Conclusion:** Model has changed to DeepSeek Reasoner, but MEMORY.md not updated. Need user confirmation and update.

## User Confirmation & Sleep (23:06)
- **User response:** "Yes happy with this as primary. Going to sleep night."
- **Action taken:** Updated `MEMORY.md` model preference to "DeepSeek Reasoner (primary), Haiku for cost-sensitive tasks (e.g., heartbeat when enabled)".
- **Note:** User sleeping – overnight proactive work window begins (10:30pm–7am). Next heartbeat due at appropriate interval.

- **Note:** Heartbeat still OFF; manual check performed as part of overnight proactive work. Cron job enabled for automated morning check.
