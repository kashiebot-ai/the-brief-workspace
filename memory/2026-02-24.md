- **Kimi (Moonshot AI) model testing initiated**: User provided API key for Kimi-K2.5 model. Researching API endpoint and testing integration.
  - ✅ API key verified working with base URL `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`
  - ✅ Model ID `kimi-k2.5` confirmed available
  - ❌ Config patch failed - provider "moonshot" not recognized by OpenClaw schema
  - ❌ Attempts with provider "openai" + baseUrl also rejected
  - Need to investigate OpenClaw provider configuration further or use environment variable approach

## Findings

- **Security audit** (cron: healthcheck): Ran `openclaw security audit` and `--deep`. No critical issues found. One warning about missing trusted proxies (low risk as Control UI is local-only). Summary saved to `security_audit_summary_2026-02-24.txt`.
- **Notion affiliate program**: Confirmed closed to new affiliates (as of Feb 2026). Updated `affiliate_programs.csv` with note.
- **Alternative affiliate programs researched**: Identified high-commission alternatives: Taskade (50% lifetime recurring), AI Studios (50% first payment), BasedLabs AI (40% lifetime), Mixo (50%), Monday.com (15-25%). Added 5 new programs to database.
- **Up-and-comers paying over the odds**: Taskade, AI Studios, BasedLabs AI, Mixo offer 40-50% commissions (aggressive programs to gain market share).
- **Copy.ai affiliate program**: Not publicly accessible (redirects to Notion login). Marked as unavailable.
- **Anyword affiliate program**: Accessible via FirstPromoter at https://anyword.firstpromoter.com/ (signup form active).
