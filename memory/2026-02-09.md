# 2026-02-09 - First Day Setup

## Session Summary
Fresh OpenClaw setup. Onboarded, created identity, set up goals.

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Name:** Kashie ✨
2. **Heartbeat frequency:** Hourly (from YouTube video recommendation)
3. **Property hunting priority:** YES - primary focus for overnight work
4. **Investment edges:** Secondary, daily hunting
5. **Discord investing group:** Join when available, monitor ideas
6. **Education:** Weekly research on OpenClaw income strategies

## Constraints Noted
- Brave Search API: Free plan = 1 query/minute rate limit
- Paid plan (~$15-20/month) = 1000 queries/day → recommended for overnight automation
- Decision: Use 1 query/minute pacing for now (acceptable for overnight hunting)

## Work Plan Setup
- Created HEARTBEAT.md with rotation: investment edges + property leads daily, Discord when joined, education weekly
- Heartbeat enabled at hourly interval (1h)
- Pacing: 1 Brave search per minute to avoid rate limits

## Next Steps
- Property lead hunting: Napier council records, company registry, development approvals
- Investment signal hunting: Market movers, regulatory changes, social sentiment
- Research: Best money-making approaches using OpenClaw
- Build/iterate on tools for tracking opportunities

## Open Items
- [ ] Brave Search API (paid key setup if needed)
- [ ] Heartbeat active + tested
- [ ] Create memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md for daily logs (THIS IS IT)
