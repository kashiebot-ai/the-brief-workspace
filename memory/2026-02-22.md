## 🎯 **MAJOR SHIFT: EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON AFFILIATE MARKETING** (6:27 PM)
**Directive received:** "I want you to drop all other work and focus exclusively on the affiliate marketing stuff. Clear it out - don't want you to think about anything else."

### Actions Taken:
1. **Updated MEMORY.md** - Rewrote "Projects & Goals" section to make affiliate marketing the **single focus**
2. **Updated expectations** - Revised "Expectations" section to reflect exclusive affiliate focus
3. **Updated proactive work plan** - Changed overnight work to 100% affiliate marketing
4. **Updated HEARTBEAT.md** - Rewrote entire checklist for affiliate marketing exclusive focus
5. **Archived other projects** - Investment research and property flipping paused indefinitely

### New Single Focus:
- **All cognitive capacity** → affiliate marketing success
- **All proactive work** → affiliate system improvements
- **All research** → affiliate optimization strategies
- **All tool building** → affiliate automation enhancements

## Session Summary
- **OpenClaw updated** from 2026.2.19-2 to **2026.2.21-2** successfully via `openclaw update`
- **Gateway service fixed**: Stopped (pid 86098), reinstalled LaunchAgent, restarted, now running (pid 86940)
- **Weekly education delivered**: Sunday briefing on "How I Work (AI Assistant Architecture)" - covered brain/memory/tools/heartbeat concepts for novice understanding
- **Affiliate marketing review**: Complete system built Feb 21 ready for launch; user needs to join affiliate programs (Notion, ClickUp, Jasper, Copy.ai) and set up website
- **Heartbeat checks**: Running normally; education task completed, investment checks skipped (outside sleep hours)

## Work

**Security Audit (cron)** - Ran `openclaw security audit` at 8:00 AM. No critical issues found. One warning: gateway.trusted_proxies_missing (reverse proxy headers not trusted). Since gateway.bind is loopback and Control UI is local-only, this is not an immediate risk. Audit summary: 0 critical, 1 warn, 1 info.

**OpenClaw Update** - Updated to version 2026.2.21-2 via standard npm update process. Gateway service had to be reinstalled (`openclaw gateway install`) and restarted after update. Service now running successfully.

**Memory System Overhaul** - Updated MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, and daily memory to reflect exclusive affiliate marketing focus per directive.

## Findings

**Weekly Education Completed** - Delivered Sunday education briefing at 2:25 PM covering AI assistant architecture: brain (DeepSeek Reasoner/Haiku), memory system (daily logs + MEMORY.md), tools/skills, heartbeat/cron scheduling. Key takeaway: user should think in outcomes not questions.

**Affiliate Marketing Status** - System is **complete and ready for launch** (built overnight Feb 21). Contains business plan, program database (19 programs), automation pipeline, website prototype, Mission Control dashboard, 7 generated articles. Awaiting user to join affiliate programs and set up WordPress to activate production mode.
