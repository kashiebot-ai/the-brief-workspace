   - Format: `explainer-[topic-slug].md`
   - Track in `CONTENT_PIPELINE.md`
   - Two-chat workflow: Planning HQ + The Brief (Production)

#### Preferences Observed
1. **Research-heavy, action-ready** — Wants comprehensive vetting before commitment; executes same day post-analysis
2. **Systematic, prioritized lists** — Prefers structured approach with direct links and status clear
3. **Pragmatic about blockers** — Notices config issues, requests investigation before accepting "can't do"
4. **API experimentation** — Willing to test alternative models (Moonshot Kimi-K2.5); wants rapid feedback on integration status

#### Action Items/Blockers
1. **BLOCKING: Domain & Hosting Setup** (Affiliate Marketing)

   - Blocking full launch: Must register domain first
   - Estimated effort: 75 minutes
