## Session Summary
Heartbeat: Investment edge hunting + property scouting. Brave API rate limits hit on property registry. Vianni analyzed Halliburton/Greenland thesis — rejected it as scaled too small to move needle.

## Work
- Ran geopolitical signal search (US-Iran tensions, Greenland drilling, emerging market rotation)
- Attempted property lead hunting (blocked by rate limits)
- Analyzed Halliburton edge with Vianni

## Findings
### Greenland/Halliburton: PASS (Not asymmetric enough)
- Real news: Greenland Energy Co + HAL contract for summer 2026 spud (Jameson Land Basin)
- Size problem: Contract is small fraction of HAL's $20B+ annual revenue
- Timeline problem: Exploration wells = high-risk, years until production
- Market problem: Already priced in from 2025 announcements
- Driver problem: HAL driven by macro (oil prices, rig counts), not single project
- Vianni's verdict: Mildly bullish catalysts ≠ 10-20% move. Not the asymmetric edge we want.

### US-Iran tensions: STILL HUNTING
- Signal confirmed (Feb 10+ reports, oil traders reassessing)
- Need: Which US companies have actual Iran/sanctions exposure without analyst coverage?
- Current blocker: Brave API rate limits (36/2000 quota)

## Open Items
- Restart company/exposure searches once API resets
- Hunt for stronger Greenland plays (other companies with higher exposure ratio?)
- Find asymmetric edges where market is genuinely sleeping (not just priced-in)
- Resume property lead scouting (Napier council records, company registry)

## Memory Search Enabled (22:20)
- **Config:** Memory search now enabled with `provider: "local"` (free, no API costs)
- **Model:** `embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0.gguf` auto‑downloaded to `~/.node‑llama‑cpp/models/`
- **Index:** 7 files → 22 chunks indexed, vector search functional
- **Test:** `openclaw memory search "investment edge"` returns relevant snippets
- **Note:** Initial indexing crashed (node‑llama‑cpp segfault) but download succeeded; second attempt OK

## Heartbeat Check & Edge Found
- **Edge:** Amkor Technology (AMKR) Q4 earnings blowout (+60% EPS surprise)
- **Thesis:** AI‑driven demand for advanced semiconductor packaging accelerating faster than Street models
- **Secondary offering:** 10M shares at $48.75 – capital raise for capacity expansion
- **Sector tailwind:** Deloitte 2026 outlook highlights AI packaging bottleneck
- **Asymmetry:** Market may under‑price scale of packaging bottlenecks as AI chips proliferate
- **Action:** Screen AMKR as direct play, or other packaging/OSAT suppliers with upcoming earnings

## Gateway Restart
- **Config patch** applied successfully after memory search enablement
- **All services healthy:** Telegram, heartbeat (1h), DeepSeek Reasoner primary, Brave API ready
- **Model‑switching strategy pending** – decide cost‑optimized routing between Reasoner/Chat

## Social Arbitrage Scanner (Chris Camillo Framework)
- **Research:** Retrieved extensive quotes/framework from Antoine Buteau's curated list of Camillo's principles
- **Key insights:**
  - Social media is the world's largest focus group; TikTok comments provide more alpha than balance sheets
  - Invest in information imbalances before they become widely accepted facts
  - Early detection of change is everything; focus on "why" before "what" shows up in numbers
  - Sell when story hits mainstream news
  - No stop losses, concentrated bets with high conviction
  - One great trade every 2‑3 years is enough for top 0.1% returns
- **Scanner MVP built:**
  - Keyword‑to‑ticker mapping CSV (20+ consumer brands)
  - Python scanner using Brave Search API (free tier) with rate‑limit respect
  - Scans for recent news mentions (past day) and flags significant volume
  - Generates briefing markdown with ticker, company, mention count, sample headlines
- **Sub‑agent launched:** `social‑arbitrage‑scanner` running overnight (full scan across all keywords, ~20 min)
- **Next:** Evaluate scanner results, refine keyword mapping, consider social‑media trend detection (Twitter/TikTok APIs)

## Heartbeat Scan (23:00)
- **Investment edges flagged:**
  - Micron (MU) – earnings +167% YoY, AI memory demand surge
  - Lenovo (LNVGY) – revenue beat on AI‑PC demand
  - Cisco (CSCO) – beat estimates, AI orders strong, stock down 7%
  - Palantir (PLTR) – earnings beat, bold 2026 guide
- **Thesis:** AI‑driven earnings surprises may not be fully priced; memory/PC refresh early innings
- **Action:** Sent Telegram alert to Vianni with summary
- **Property lead scouting:** Limited by web search noise; need automated council data scrape
- **Social arbitrage scanner:** Sub‑agent running; results pending
- **Vianni reaction:** "Huh" / "?" to Telegram alert – surprised at detailed overnight work; clarified following the deal

## Social Arbitrage Scan (22:50-22:57)
- **Scanner execution:** Initiated social arbitrage scanner as requested
- **Progress:** Scanner started successfully but encountered timing issues
- **Findings from partial scan:**
  - "Stanley drinkware" (SWK): 1 mention in past day
  - "Birkin bag" (RMS): 10 mentions in past day (significant volume)
- **Issue:** Scanner runs at 1 query per minute (Brave API free tier rate limit)
- **Timing:** With 33 keywords, full scan would take ~33 minutes, not 20 minutes as estimated
- **Status:** Scanner completed partial run (2/33 keywords); subagent finished successfully
- **Recommendation:** Run scanner during off-hours (33 min full scan) or reduce keyword set
- **Key insight:** "Birkin bag" (Hermès) showing high social media/news traction with 10 mentions in past day
- **Technical:** Scanner robust with improved error handling for rate limits; Brave API key working

## Property Lead Research (23:30)
- **Data sources identified:**
  - Napier City Council Open Data (parcel CSV via WFS)
  - LINZ Data Service (property titles, owner info — needs API key)
  - NZ Companies Office (property‑holding entities)
- **Sample fetched:** LINZ_NAPIERPARCEL CSV (9 records) — contains parcel IDs, titles, geometry
- **Limitation:** No owner names in council data; need LINZ API for title lookups
- **Plan:** Weekend registration for LINZ API, build automated parcel‑to‑owner mapper
- **File created:** `property_data.md` with detailed roadmap

## Overnight Summary
- **Investment edges:** 4 AI‑earnings beats flagged (MU, LNVGY, CSCO, PLTR)
- **Social arbitrage scanner:** Partial run (2/33 keywords) — Hermès (RMS) shows traction
- **Property research:** Data sources mapped, automation pipeline designed
- **Next:** Full scanner run tomorrow, LINZ API registration, evaluate AI‑memory thesis deeper

## System Note
- **Context usage:** 183k/200k tokens (91%) – compaction imminent
- **Memory search:** Enabled with local embeddings (zero cost)
- **Strategy:** Allow automatic compaction; rely on memory search for continuity

## Heartbeat Check (23:03)
- **Investment edge hunting:** 
  - Siemens (SIE.DE/SIEGY) – raised 2026 profit outlook on AI‑driven data‑center demand (Reuters). Signal: AI infrastructure broadening to industrials.
  - Planet Labs (PL) – defense advisory boards announced at Munich Security Conference (geopolitical tensions rising).
  - Trinity Industries (TRN) – 230% EPS surprise (railcar cyclical recovery; includes one‑time gain).
- **Property lead scouting:** Data sources mapped; LINZ API registration planned for weekend.
- **Scanner status:** Partial run completed (Hermès signal). Full scan scheduled for tomorrow.

## Heartbeat Check (00:06)
- **Investment edge hunting (after‑hours):**
  - Rivian (RIVN) – revenue beat ($1.29B vs $1.26B), stock +14% after hours. Signal: EV demand recovery, R2 deliveries doubling in 2026.
  - Applied Materials (AMAT) – earnings beat, stock +13% after hours. Signal: AI semiconductor equipment demand remains strong.
  - Sanrio (Japanese) – earnings beat, stock poised to hit daily limit. Signal: consumer discretionary strength.
- **Property lead scouting:** No new leads via web search; council data requires LINZ API (weekend registration).
- **Context:** 100% full, compaction occurred; memory search functional.
