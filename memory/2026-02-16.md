- **Delivered:** Three‑part beginner's guide (how I work, key concepts, practical tips).
- **Next deep‑dive:** How memory works (next Sunday).

### 2. Model Preference Update
- **Was:** Haiku (outdated in `MEMORY.md`).
- **Is:** DeepSeek Reasoner (primary), Haiku for cost‑sensitive tasks.

### 3. Proactive Scheduling

- **Purpose:** Automated morning edge check before you wake up.
- **Heartbeat:** Still OFF (saving costs).

### 4. Investment Edge Hunting (3 checks)
- **23:15, 23:23, 00:22:** Scanned for breaking news, geopolitical, FDA, earnings, controversies.
- **Findings:**
  - **Iran:** US military preparing for weeks‑long operations; talks Tuesday in Geneva (unchanged edge).
