# Saturday, February 28, 2026 — Planning HQ

## Session Summary
Pivot day. User clarified the confusion from multi-chat context pollution — affiliate marketing was stopped in the-brief chat, but I was still operating on stale MEMORY.md from main chat. Established new two-chat workflow to prevent this.

## Work

### Completed
- [x] Two-chat workflow established (Planning HQ vs the-brief)
- [x] MEMORY.md updated with The Brief as active project
- [x] Affiliate marketing properly archived
- [x] Memory structure created (per-chat daily logs + project folders)
- [x] Full scope locked: Policy explainers + VoteFinder quiz + (later) politician tracking

### Decisions Made (with user)
1. **Tech stack:** Next.js + Sanity CMS (custom build, not WordPress)
2. **Scope:** Start with explainers + quiz, add MP tracking later
3. **Name:** "The Brief" (site) / "The Briefing" (newsletter) — final TBD
4. **Build approach:** Temp URL now (the-brief-demo.vercel.app), migrate domain later
5. **Chat split:** Planning HQ = strategy/decisions, the-brief = production/execution

### In Progress
- [ ] Website build (Codex overnight session)
- [ ] Domain research (user negotiating for preferred domain)

## Cross-Chat Context
**the-brief chat status:**
- First explainer drafted ("How Parliament Works")
- Website build started
- User to review content there

## Findings

### Key Decisions
- Two-chat isolation prevents context pollution
- Custom build (Next.js) gives full control vs WordPress
- Temp URL strategy unblocks development during domain negotiation

### Preferences Observed
- Values clean separation between strategy and execution chats
- Prefers to iterate on name/tone organically
- Comfortable with "build now, polish later" approach

## Open Items
- [ ] Final name confirmation
- [ ] Domain acquisition result
- [ ] First explainer review (in the-brief chat)
- [ ] Quiz question set development

## Notes
**Memory system upgraded:** Now using per-chat daily logs to prevent cross-contamination. Planning HQ (this chat) for strategy, the-brief for production work.

**Active Codex Project:** The Brief website build — temp URL expected by tomorrow morning.
