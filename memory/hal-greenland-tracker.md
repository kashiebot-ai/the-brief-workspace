## 🎯 EXIT STRATEGY (DETAILED)

### **RULE 1: The First Spike (Mandatory Exit)**
**Trigger:** Halliburton named for Greenland infrastructure contract
**Timeline:** June 2026 expected

**Exit Plan:**
1. **Sell 50% of stock immediately** (at first spike)
   - Target: $48-52 (30-50% gain)
   - Timing: Same day or next trading day after news
   - Rationale: Lock in 50% of your gain. Greed kills edge trades.

2. **Close all call options at peak**
   - Sell any ITM or OTM calls immediately
   - Realistic gain: 200-500% on June calls
   - Don't wait for expiration

3. **Keep 50% of stock for long-term (secondary position)**
   - Hold at $48+ (you've locked in gains)
   - Let it ride for 2-3 years
   - Revenue ramp from 2027 onwards = steady climb

---

### **RULE 2: The Secondary Exit (Profit Taking)**
**If HAL doesn't spike on contract news (delayed spike):**

**Exit Plan:**
- **+25% gain** ($40 on $32 entry): Sell 30% of stock
- **+40% gain** ($45 on $32): Sell another 25%
- **+60% gain** ($51 on $32): Sell remaining 45% (except long-term hold)

**Reasoning:** Lock in gains at each milestone. Don't wait for the "perfect exit."

---

### **RULE 3: The Extended Hold (If You Sell Early)**
**If you sold stock early (before June), when to re-enter?**

**Entry 2 - The Dip:**
- Post-announcement, stock pulls back 10-15% after spike
- **Re-entry:** $42-44 (6-8 weeks after first spike)
- **Hold:** 2-3 years (let revenue ramp drive long-term growth)

---

### **RULE 4: The "It Didn't Work" Exit (Risk Management)**
**If by Sept 2026:**
- No contract announced
- HAL still at $32-35
- Greenland deal stalled

**Exit Plan:**
- Close options (cut loss: -50 to -100%)
- Hold stock OR cut loss (decide based on other fundamentals)
- Move capital to next edge
