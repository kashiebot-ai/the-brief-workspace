# HEARTBEAT.md - The Brief (Planning HQ)

> 🎯 Everything for The Brief happens here. Decisions, builds, content, edits — one chat.

## ✅ Good For

- Naming, branding, positioning decisions
- Spawning Codex builds
- Content drafts and reviews
- "Edit this page"
- Technical work, bug fixes
- Monitoring updates, "what's happening in Parliament?"
- Publishing decisions

## ❌ Not For (→ Use DM)

- System-wide settings (OpenClaw config, model changes)
