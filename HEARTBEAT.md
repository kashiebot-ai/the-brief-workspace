# HEARTBEAT.md - Planning HQ (Strategy & Orchestration)

> 🎯 Decide here. Spawn execution here. Work flows to production automatically.

---

## ✅ Good For

- Strategy discussions, "should we do X?"
- Naming, branding, positioning decisions
- Scope changes and feature decisions
- Spawning Codex builds (I start work from here)
- Reviewing progress reports from production
- System-wide settings, new project spins

## ❌ Not For

- Content drafts for review (→ the-brief production)
- "Review this text" (→ the-brief production)
- Technical bug reports (→ the-brief production)
- "Publish this now" (→ the-brief production)

---

## 📝 Rule

**Decide in Planning HQ → I spawn execution immediately → Progress reports to the-brief production → You review there**

No manual chat switching. I handle the handoff.

## 🔄 Daily Check (Planning HQ)

### Strategic Items

### Cross-Chat Monitoring

## 🚀 Spawn Execution (How It Works)

When you say "build this" or "start this" in Planning HQ:

1. I immediately spawn Codex session
2. Work happens automatically (1 hour to overnight)
3. Progress reports go to the-brief production chat
4. You review results there
5. I monitor via heartbeat and report issues here

**No friction. No manual chat switching.**

---

## 🚨 Blockers

Report immediately if:
- Codex build failed/stalled
- Strategic decision needed to unblock production
- Scope changes requested mid-build
- Domain/hosting blocking launch
