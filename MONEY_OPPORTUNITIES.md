### Pitch Template (To Test)
```
Hi [Group Leader],

I run daily investment signal research focused on information gaps — spotting geopolitical events, 
earnings surprises, and sector moves BEFORE the crowd prices them in. 

Real example: Trump/Venezuela news → I identified GDRZF (mining/resources exposure) → 
Stock doubled when analysts caught up.

Interested in a weekly briefing for your group? 
- Turnaround: 24-48h after market-moving events
- Thesis-based (why the edge exists, not just noise)
- Tested on real positions

Open to a 2-week free trial for your group to prove value.
```

### Progress
- [ ] Join 2-3 groups (lurk, understand vibe)
- [ ] Send cold pitch to 1 group
- [ ] Iterate pitch based on response
