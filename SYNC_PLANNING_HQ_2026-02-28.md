# 📋 Context Sync: Planning HQ → The Brief Project
**Date:** Saturday, February 28, 2026, ~10:00 AM NZST  
**Source:** DM chat with Kashie  
**Destination:** Planning HQ group chat

---

## ✅ DECISIONS MADE TODAY

### 1. Chat Workflow Finalized
| Chat | Purpose | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Planning HQ** (group) | Strategy, decisions, spawning builds | Say "build this" → Kashie spawns Codex immediately |
| **the-brief production** (group) | Execution, reviews, drafts | Receive work, review, approve |
| **DM** (this chat) | Personal, system settings, other projects | Admin, new project spins |

**Key Rule:** No manual chat switching. Decide in Planning HQ → Work flows to production automatically.

### 2. Time/Date Tracking Fix
- Added explicit timeline tracking to tacit knowledge
- "Last night" = Feb 27 (not ancient history)
- Check daily notes before assuming something is "new"

### 3. Memory Structure Complete
- Per-chat daily logs created (prevents context pollution)
- Affiliate marketing archived to `memory/projects/affiliate-marketing/`
- The Brief knowledge base at `memory/life/knowledge/projects/the-brief.md`
- MEMORY.md updated with current scope
