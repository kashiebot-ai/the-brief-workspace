# Chris Camillo Social Arbitrage Framework

*Source: Antoine Buteau's curated list of Camillo quotes & principles*

## Core Philosophy

- **Social Arbitrage:** Exploiting information gaps between social/media trends and Wall Street recognition
- **Information Imbalance:** Buy upon discovery of an information imbalance; sell when that information becomes widely accepted as fact by Wall Street
- **Early Detection of Change:** Everything is about early detection of change. That's it.
- **Wall Street vs. Social Arb:** Wall Street focuses on the "what" (financials); social arb investors focus on the "why" before the "what" shows up in numbers

## Key Principles

### Data Sources
- **Social media = world's largest focus group**
- TikTok comments provide more alpha than reading a balance sheet
- Leverage personal network — family and friends know things you don't
- Stop watching CNBC; it's mostly noise designed to keep you from acting on your own observations
- Ground‑level excitement (people lining up) is more reliable than an analyst's report

### Mindset
- **One great trade every 2–3 years is all it takes to join the top 0.1% of investors**
- Invest with concentration, not diversification, when you have high conviction
- Never ever use stop losses (they kick you out of good trades during noise)
- A losing trade is not necessarily a "bad" trade if you followed your process
- The goal isn't to be right; the goal is to make money
- Patience is the ability to wait on pins and needles until a true imbalance crosses your path

### Execution
- **Bucket your money:**
  - "Lockbox" for safety
  - "Big Money Account" for aggressive, concentrated bets
- Use "Other People's Money" (OPM) — money saved from daily habits (like skipping a $5 latte) to fund your Big Money Account
- Wait for the "needle mover" — information that will materially impact the company’s bottom line
- Sell when the story you discovered hits the mainstream news
- Don't invest in things everyone is already talking about (no alpha in the consensus)

### Detection Signals
- Trends often start as "daily rituals" on social media before they show up in quarterly earnings
- Influencer reviews can move millions of dollars in product faster than any marketing campaign
- Real‑world inventory shortages can be a leading indicator for a stock's decline
- Political figures wearing a brand can cause immediate, sustained stock rallies that Wall Street takes months to price in
- Fashion trends that evoke strong emotional reactions (love or hate) often lead to the best investment returns
- If a trend is "cringe," it might actually be a massive investment opportunity

## Famous Trades (Examples)
- Celsius Energy Drink
- E.L.F. Beauty (Jeffree Star reviews)
- Snapple (inventory shortages)
- Wendy’s Pretzel Bun (ground‑level excitement)
- Elmer’s Glue (slime trend)
- J. Crew (Michelle Obama wearing the brand)
- Crocs/Uggs (emotional fashion trends)
- Tesla ("experience gap" between users and analysts)
- COVID‑19 Puts (signals from Chinese medical boards)
- Mattel (Barbie movie cultural revival)

## Practical Scanner Implications

1. **Monitor social/media for emerging "daily rituals" and emotional reactions**
2. **Map trends to public companies** (including parent brands)
3. **Detect information imbalance** — is Wall Street talking about this yet?
4. **Act before consensus** — when the story hits mainstream news, it's time to sell
5. **Concentrate positions** when conviction is high; ignore noise
