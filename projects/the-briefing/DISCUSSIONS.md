> Raw capture of conversations. Chronological. Unfiltered.

## 2026-02-27 — Morning

### Context Recovery
User was frustrated that I couldn't see prior conversation about policy site. Explained that:
- I wake up fresh each session
- Memory = files + current session only
- Prior chat history not automatically loaded
- Solution: Document everything in files (this system)

User shared PDF documenting full discussion from previous session. Key points captured:

### The Concept (from PDF)
**"Councillor" → "The Briefing"**
- AI translation layer between NZ government and citizens
- Monitor council/parliament agendas, bills, votes
- Plain English summaries: "Here's what they're doing, why it matters, how it affects you"
- Weekly email + website archive
- Election countdown (Nov 7, 2026)

### Competitive Landscape
- **CityWatchNZ:** Activist/conspiracy-leaning, 96 followers, not professional
- **Gap:** No neutral, professional, comprehensive service exists

### Monetization Paths Discussed
1. Local business sponsorship
2. Tip jar / Patreon
3. Grant funding (democracy initiatives)
4. Developer/property pro tier ($50-100/mo) — real-time alerts, project pipeline
5. White-label to other regions
6. Data licensing (researchers, journalists)
7. Election cycle: paid candidate profiles, voter guides

### User Request
Build documentation system + control centre to track everything. This is the sole focus moving forward.
