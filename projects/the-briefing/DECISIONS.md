### DECISION: Pivot from Affiliate Marketing to Civic News
**Context:** Affiliate marketing system built but not launched. User reviewed the opportunity and wants to focus on higher-impact civic news project with election timing advantage.
**Decision:** Pause affiliate marketing indefinitely. All resources to The Briefing/Councillor concept.
**Rationale:** 
- Elections Nov 7, 2026 = 8 months away (perfect timing)
- Weak competition in NZ civic news space
- Personal interest/alignment higher
- Monetization paths clearer long-term

### DECISION: Start National, Not Local
**Context:** Original concept was "Councillor" (local councils). User questioned expanding to NZ government.
**Decision:** Lead with national politics ("The Briefing"), potentially add local layer later.
**Rationale:**
- Bigger audience (3.5M voters vs 150K local)
- Higher stakes issues (tax, health, education)
- More media oxygen to ride
- Election countdown creates natural urgency

### DECISION: Build Control Centre + Documentation First
**Context:** Need systematic way to track decisions, content, progress.
**Decision:** Before any content creation, build:
1. Project documentation structure (this repo)
2. Updated Mission Control dashboard
3. Decision logging system
**Rationale:** Scattered discussions in chat = lost context. Proper tracking from day one.
