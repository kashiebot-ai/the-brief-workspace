## Why This Matters

Every law affecting your life — tax, health, housing, crime — went through the process described below. Understanding how it works gives you power to participate.

## The Cast of Characters

### Parliament (120 MPs)
Elected by you every 3 years. Their jobs:
- Make laws
- Hold the Government to account
- Represent your interests

**Government** = The party (or coalition) with 61+ seats. They run the country.

**Opposition** = Everyone else. Their job is to question, challenge, and offer alternatives.

**Speaker** = The referee. An MP (usually from Government benches) who keeps order.

### The Executive (The Government)
- **Prime Minister** = Leader of the biggest party
- **Cabinet** = Senior ministers who make key decisions
- **Ministers** = Each runs a department (Health, Education, Finance, etc.)

```

**Key point:** The Government *usually* controls Parliament (they have the votes), but technically Parliament is supreme. The Government needs Parliament's approval to change laws or spend significant money.

     ↓
    📖 First Reading (debate: do we want this at all?)
     ↓
    👥 Select Committee (public input, recommend changes)
     ↓
    📖 Second Reading (debate the details)

## The Eight Steps Explained

### Step 1: Someone Has an Idea
- Usually a minister says "we need to fix X"
- Or an ordinary MP proposes a change (called a "Member's Bill")

### Step 2: It Becomes a Bill
- Lawyers draft the actual legal text
- Published publicly so anyone can read it

### Step 3: First Reading
- Parliament debates the *principle* — do we want this at all?
- Vote: 50% to continue
- Most bills pass this stage

### Step 4: Select Committee ⭐
- Bill goes to a small group of MPs (usually cross-party)
- **Public can submit opinions** (this is your chance to be heard)
- Committee can suggest changes
- **This is where most changes happen**

### Step 5: Second Reading
- Parliament debates the *details*
- More changes possible

### Step 6: Committee of the Whole House
- Every MP can suggest tweaks
- Line-by-line examination

### Step 7: Third Reading
- Final debate
- Final vote

### Step 8: Royal Assent
- Governor-General signs it (formality)
- Becomes law (now called an "Act")

## Timeline: How Long Does This Take?

```
⏱️ URGENT:        [========]                    (weeks — very rare)
⏱️ NORMAL:        [====================]        (6-18 months)
⏱️ COMPLEX:       [====================================] (years)
💀 MOST BILLS:    [XX] dies here                 (never make it)
```

Most bills die somewhere along the way — withdrawn, voted down, or simply never scheduled.

## The Stuff Nobody Explains

### Question Time
- Every sitting day, 2-3pm
- Opposition MPs ask ministers questions
- Usually political theatre, sometimes genuinely revealing
- Watch live on [Parliament TV](https://www.parliament.nz/en/watch-parliament/)

### Urgent Debates
- If something major happens, Parliament can debate it immediately
- Requires the Speaker's approval

### Private Members' Bills
- Ordinary MPs (not ministers) can propose laws too
- Most fail, but some become major changes
- Example: Same-sex marriage started as a Member's Bill

### The Budget
- Once a year, Government reveals spending plans
- Huge debate, opposition responds with their alternative

## Your Points of Power

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         🎯 YOUR POINTS OF POWER        │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🗳️  Vote (every 3 years)              │
│  📝  Submit to Select Committees       │
│  📧  Email/call your MP                │
│  📺  Watch Question Time               │

└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The reality:**
- Most day-to-day decisions happen in Cabinet, not Parliament
- But Parliament is where laws get locked in — or stopped
- Select Committees actually read public submissions
