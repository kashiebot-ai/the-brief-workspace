## The Short Version

Under MMP (Mixed Member Proportional), you get **two votes**:
1. **Party vote** — "Which party should run the country?"
2. **Electorate vote** — "Who should be my local MP?"

The party vote decides how many seats each party gets in Parliament. The electorate vote decides who represents your local area.

Simple, right? Well, mostly. Let's dig into why we have this system and how it actually plays out.

## Why Did NZ Switch to MMP?

Before 1996, New Zealand used "First Past the Post" (FPP) — the same system the UK and US still use. Whoever got the most votes in each area won the seat. Simple.

**The problem:**
- In 1978, National won government despite Labour getting more votes
- In 1981, it happened again
- In 1993, Labour got more votes but National stayed in power

Voters were tired of their votes not counting. In a 1993 referendum, 54% voted to switch to MMP. The first MMP election was in 1996.

## Your Two Votes Explained

### Vote 1: The Party Vote (The Big One)

This vote determines the overall makeup of Parliament. If a party gets 30% of the party vote, they get roughly 30% of the seats (about 36 MPs).

**Why it matters:** This is the vote that decides who forms the Government. Think of it as "Which party's vision do I support?"

### Vote 2: The Electorate Vote (The Local One)

This vote chooses who represents your specific area (electorate) in Parliament. There are 72 electorates — 65 general and 7 Māori.

**Why it matters:** This person becomes your local MP. You can contact them for help with government issues. They represent your area's interests.

## How Seats Are Calculated (The Maths Bit)

Don't worry — this is simpler than it looks.

**Total seats in Parliament:** 120

**Electorate seats (72):** Won directly by whoever gets the most votes in that area

**List seats (48):** Allocated to make Parliament match the party vote proportions

**Example:**
```
Party A gets 40% of party vote → entitled to 48 seats (40% of 120)
They win 35 electorate seats → need 13 list seats to reach 48

Party B gets 30% of party vote → entitled to 36 seats
They win 20 electorate seats → need 16 list seats

Party C gets 20% of party vote → entitled to 24 seats
They win 15 electorate seats → need 9 list seats

Party D gets 10% of party vote → entitled to 12 seats
They win 2 electorate seats → need 10 list seats
```

The list seats "top up" the electorate results to match the party vote.

## The "Overhang" and Other Weirdness

Sometimes things get complicated:

### Overhang
If a party wins more electorate seats than their party vote entitles them to, they keep those extra seats. Parliament gets bigger temporarily.

**Example:** In 2020, Labour won 46 electorate seats but their party vote only entitled them to about 43 total seats. Parliament expanded to 121 MPs.

### The 5% Threshold
A party must get either:
- 5% of the party vote, OR
- Win at least one electorate seat

If they don't meet either, they get no seats. Their votes are effectively redistributed to parties that did make it.

**Real example:** In 2017, the Greens got 6.3% (in Parliament). In 2020, NZ First got 7.6% but no electorates — they got seats. In 2020, New Conservative got 2.6% and no electorates — zero seats despite 62,000 votes.

## Strategic Voting (Should You Game the System?)

Some people try to "game" MMP:
- "I'll give my party vote to a small party I like, and my electorate vote to a major party"
- "I'll vote for the candidate most likely to beat the one I hate"

**Our take:** MMP is pretty robust to gaming. The party vote is what matters for Government formation. Your electorate vote mostly determines your local MP.

**The safest strategy:** Vote for what you actually believe. The system is designed to reflect preferences proportionally.

## Coalitions: Why MMP Usually Means Power-Sharing

Under FPP, one party often got 50%+ of seats and ruled alone. Under MMP, that's rare.

**How Government Formation Works:**
1. After the election, parties negotiate to form a coalition with 61+ seats
2. The biggest party usually leads, but not always
3. Small parties extract concessions for their support

**Examples:**
- **1996-1998:** National + NZ First
- **1999-2008:** Labour + Alliance/Greens (confidence) / Progressive
- **2008-2017:** National + ACT + United Future + Māori
- **2017-2020:** Labour + NZ First + Greens (confidence)
- **2020-2023:** Labour + Greens (confidence)
- **2023-present:** National + ACT + NZ First

**Why this matters:** Your vote for a small party isn't "wasted" — it might give them kingmaker power.

## The Pros and Cons of MMP

### Pros
✅ **Fairness:** Parties get seats proportional to their vote  
✅ **Choice:** You can split your vote (different party and candidate)  
✅ **Representation:** More diverse voices in Parliament  
✅ **Cooperation:** Forces parties to work together  
✅ **No wasted votes:** Small parties can win representation

### Cons
❌ **Complexity:** Two votes confuse some voters  
❌ "**Kingmakers**": Small parties can hold disproportionate power  
❌ **Instability:** Coalitions can break down (see: 1996-1998)  
❌ **Accountability:** Harder to "throw the bums out" when parties share power  
❌ **List MPs:** Not directly elected by voters

## Common MMP Myths

### Myth: "The party with the most votes automatically wins"
**Reality:** They get first crack at forming Government, but if other parties combine against them, they can be blocked. (Unlikely but possible.)

### Myth: "Electorate votes are more important"
**Reality:** Party votes determine the overall balance of power. Electorate votes determine local representation.

### Myth: "Small parties have too much power"
**Reality:** They have *leverage* in negotiations, but big parties still dominate. ACT had 8.6% in 2023 but got major policy wins because National needed them.

### Myth: "MMP is undemocratic"
**Reality:** It's arguably *more* democratic — Parliament looks more like how people actually voted.

## What Happens to Your Votes?

**Scenario 1:** You vote for a party that gets 4% and no electorates  
→ Their votes are effectively ignored. Parliament is allocated as if those voters didn't exist.

**Scenario 2:** You split your vote — Labour party vote, National electorate vote  
→ Totally valid. About 30% of voters do this.

**Scenario 3:** You only vote for an electorate candidate and leave party vote blank  
→ Your party vote is informal (doesn't count).

---

## The Bottom Line

MMP isn't perfect, but it gives you more choice than the old system:
- Vote for your preferred party nationally
- Vote for your preferred local MP (even if different party)
- Support small parties without "wasting" your vote
- Get a Parliament that reflects NZ's diversity

**Your job:** Use both votes wisely. They matter.
